# AddCardToAnki

Adds a list of Japanese words in a comma separated .txt file to a .csv file that can them be imported to Anki.
Resultant csv will contain info on the word's reading, english definition, japanese definition, and example sentences (if available).

This program assumes you have the `wnjpn.db` sqlite file obtained from https://bond-lab.github.io/wnja/index.en.html . It is too large to upload to this repository.
